### Hi there, 

I'm **Dom Binks** and I'm a third year computer science student studying at the [University of Nottingham](https://www.nottingham.ac.uk/ugstudy/course/Computer-Science-MSci).

Most of my repositories are either hackathon projects such as [Image from images](https://github.com/dombinks/image-from-images) or my solutions to competitive programming problems on different platforms like [Kattis](https://github.com/dombinks/kattis) and [LeetCode](https://github.com/dombinks/leetcode). I am also currently working on [Lang Map](https://github.com/dombinks/lang-map) which is an interactive tool for visualising the languages that different countries speak.

Feel free to contact me via [Email](mailto:contact@dombinks.dev) or [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/dominic-binks-020690220/).
